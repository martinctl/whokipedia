Test your knowledge of the who's who in Whokipedia, where each clue leads you closer to uncovering the celebrity behind the blur.

### Description 
Our web app is a game called Whokipedia. It takes its root in the famous game "Guess Who ?", and is inspired from the wikipedia interface. As a player you will start with a wikipedia-like page with some basic information about a mysterious celebritiy. Your goal is to try to guess the celebrity, for instance a first hint could be the birthdate. If you fail to guess correctly at first, we will give you a second hint (could be a sentence from the wikipedia description, the occupation, nationality, blurred photo, â€¦) and reveal it as a part of the wikipedia interface. Each time you make a guess, you get a new hint, until you finally uncover the celebrity is or until all hints are revealed. The less hints you needed, the better your rank ! <br>

There are two modes, daily challenges and training. In training, you play for yourself, and can play as many times as you want. The daily challenges take their inspiration from wordle. The goal stays the same but there is only one celebrity to guess each day. For the daily challenges, a leaderboard is created. If you want your score to be displayed on the leaderboard, you should be loged in, however you can also play as a visitor but that means that your performance will not be saved. <br>

Finally, once the game is done and the celebrity revealed, a link to the wikipedia page of the celebrity will appear, inviting you to learn more about the celebrity of the day if your curiosity has been spiked. If you are loged in, you can also browse through your old games, points, and celebrities found.
